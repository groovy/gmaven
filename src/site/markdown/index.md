# GMaven

<img src="https://groovy.github.io/gmaven/images/gmaven.png" style="float: right;"/>

[Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org) integration for [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org).

## Supported Environments

* Java 1.6+
* Groovy 2.0+
* Groovy 2.1+
* Apache Maven 3.0+
* Apache Maven 3.1+

## Features

* Script execution
* GUI console access
* Command-line shell access

For more details please see the [groovy-maven-plugin](groovy-maven-plugin/index.html) documentation.

## No Compilation Support

GMaven 2.x no longer supports any integration for compilation of Groovy sources.  There were too many problems with
stub-generation and hooking up compliation to the proper Maven lifecycle phases to effectivly support.

For compliation integration with Maven please see the
[Groovy Eclipse Compiler](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GROOVY/Groovy-Eclipse+compiler+plugin+for+Maven),
which is the recommended and prefered option.  If any problems are discovered with the compiler please
[report an issue](http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GRECLIPSE).

As a fallback the [Groovy ant tasks](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Compiling+With+Maven2) can also be used
if for some reason the prefered option is not viable for the target environment.
