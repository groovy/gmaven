# Shell

GMaven supports running the command-line [Groovy Shell](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy+Shell)
(aka `groovysh`) with the [shell](shell-mojo.html) goal:

    mvn groovy:shell

This goal works with and without a project.  When a project is available additional [classpath](classpath.html)
configuration options are avaiable.

All context [variables](variables.html) are availble for use in the shell.
