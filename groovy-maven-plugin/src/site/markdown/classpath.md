# Classpath

When executing a goal with a Maven project, GMaven can provide access to the classpath of the project for a
particular scope.  This is controlled by the `classpathScope` parameter.

For example, to execute a script and include the `runtime` scope dependencencies on the classpath:

    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.codehaus.gmaven</groupId>
      <artifactId>groovy-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <phase>process-classes</phase>
          <goals>
              <goal>execute</goal>
          </goals>
          <configuration>
            <classpathScope>runtime</classpathScope>
            <source>
              // this script has access to the compiled classes and all depencencies of scope=runtime.
            </source>
          </configuration>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>

By default `classpathScope` is set to `none` which means that no additional classpath elements will be available.

When executing a goal directly without a project, the scope may be configured by setting the `scope` property:

    mvn groovy:shell -Dscope=test

For all supported values and additional documentation see
[ClasspathScope](apidocs/org/codehaus/gmaven/plugin/ClasspathScope.html).

Any additional classpath which may be needed can also be configured on the plugin definition:

    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.codehaus.gmaven</groupId>
      <artifactId>groovy-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <dependencies>
        <dependency>
          <groupId>commons-lang</groupId>
          <artifactId>commons-lang</artifactId>
          <version>2.6</version>
        </dependency>
      </dependencies>
    </plugin>
