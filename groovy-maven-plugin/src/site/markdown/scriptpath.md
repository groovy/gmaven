# Scriptpath

The `scriptpath` is a path where GMaven will search for additional Groovy sources to resolve when executing a Groovy script.

This configuration applies to all goals.  This means that you can access your external script via the `console`
and `shell` goals as well as `execute`.

### Explicit

For example if you have a class named `Helper` defined in a file named `${project.basedir}/src/main/script/Helper.groovy`
your scripts can use that class if you configure the script path to include `${project.basedir}/src/main/script`:

    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.codehaus.gmaven</groupId>
      <artifactId>groovy-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <phase>generate-resources</phase>
          <goals>
              <goal>execute</goal>
          </goals>
          <configuration>
            <scriptpath>
              <path>${project.basedir}/src/main/script</path>
            </scriptpath>
            <source>
              import Helper
              def h = new Helper()
            </source>
          </configuration>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>

### Peer

Additionally if using a file-based source configuration, GMaven will automatically look for
matching classes _nexus to_ the source file.

So if you had a `${project.basedir}/src/main/script/Main.groovy` with something like:

    import Helper
    def h = new Helper()

... then this configuration would be sufficent to allow the source file script to access to
`${project.basedir}/src/main/script/Helper.groovy` script:

    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.codehaus.gmaven</groupId>
      <artifactId>groovy-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <phase>generate-resources</phase>
          <goals>
              <goal>execute</goal>
          </goals>
          <configuration>
            <source>${project.basedir}/src/main/script/Main.groovy</source>
          </configuration>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>

### Command-line

Configure the `scriptpath` property on the mvn command-line with a _comma seperated_ list of entries:

    mvn -Dscriptpath=dir1,dir2,dir3
